# Task-5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Titanic EDA - Sample Submission
This bundle contains a sample Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the Titanic dataset.

## Files
- `titanic_dataset_sample.csv` - sample CSV file (20 rows) to run the notebook quickly.
- `EDA_titanic_sample.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with EDA steps (load CSV, describe, visualize).
- `EDA_report_titanic_sample.pdf` - Short PDF summarizing the EDA findings and instructions.
- 
## How to run
1. Open `EDA_titanic_sample.ipynb` in Jupyter (or VS Code Jupyter extension).
2. Make sure `titanic_dataset_sample.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Run cells sequentially. The notebook creates visualizations using matplotlib/seaborn.
